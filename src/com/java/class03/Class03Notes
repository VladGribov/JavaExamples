Identifiers

	what? - It's a user defined name to identify class name, variable name & method name

	why? - We need to identify class, method, variable in java uniquely

	Rules:

		1) Allow chat 0-9, a-z, $, _
		2) Case sensitive
		3) Can't use keywords
		4) Can't start with digits

		Valid   : _a_, abc123, num_1
		Invalid : 1num, num 1, num-1
DataTypes:

	What?	- It's a type of data we want to store in a variable

	Why?	- We need to specify which type of data we need to store in a variable

	Data Types:
		Primitive	Non Primitive

		byte		String
		short
		int
		long
		float
		double
		char
		boolean

	Primitive	- It's a direct value
	Non Primitive	- It's an object

Variables:

	What?	- It's a container for storing data. Reference to a memory where we are storing data

	Why?	- We need to store data during the program so variable will help to crate container for that data.

	1) Declaration of variable

		int num1;

	2) Assigning value to variable

		num1 = 10;

	3) Declaration and Initialization

		int num1 = 10;
